<h1><b>Abstract</b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 outbreak was characterized as a pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020. As the new epidemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads, there has been a lot of research for better understanding on the effects of the virus. We can help the global community and researchers to better understand the disease by sharing insights derived from datasets which are available in Kaggle. We used the publicly available COVID-19 related datasets </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">from sources like Johns Hopkins, United Nations and many others.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Since data clustering is one of the useful unsupervised learning that groups data into clusters, we decided to use clustering methods, K-means and GMM, to group similar countries together so that we get insight into finding the similar attributes and hidden patterns of COVID-19 clusters</span>

<h1><b>Introduction and Related Work</b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are attempting to analyse how we could effectively group different countries based on various features like health conditions of people, nourishment levels, testing done, access to healthcare etc. by using 2 different clustering algorithms, K-Means and Expectation Maximization using Gaussian Mixture Models. We are also trying to find out which factors are affecting Covid-19 cases the most and analyse how the top 5 factors are affecting the Covid-19 cases in different countries.</span>

<b>Figure 1:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Map of confirmed COVID-19 Cases in different countries</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The figure</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">above shows countries grouped with respect to the number of COVID-19 cases. It can be analysed that most of the countries are in low range. It also shows the USA having the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. However, clustering countries only on the basis of confirmed COVID-19 cases will be a naive approach. No conclusive and preventive measures can be concluded from such clustering. In order to address the problem of clustering countries such that it gives important information about their characteristics can help us to develop a strategy ahead of time that will help us prevent sudden outbreaks of such pandemics in the future. For instance, if our experiments find a country characteristically similar to the United States of America, we can learn from the pros and cons of the country and use it to make better policies and decisions in the other similarly grouped countries. This will help us to evade expected dangers and help policy makers design better policies and practices to keep the impact of this pandemic to the minimum.</span>


<h1><b>Conclusion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This experiment identified the top factors that indicated a higher ratio of confirmed COVID-19 cases: current health expenditure per capita, test ratio, HDI, informed risk, and mortality rate under 5. We showed the necessity of scaling the data to similar magnitudes in order to give the different factors an even weight in clustering. By looking at the elbow curve of the sum of squared differences between data points and their clusters, we were able to find 5 clusters to be the optimal number of clusters for our data. The mutual information regression of the ratio of confirmed cases against the other factors allowed us to identify current health expenditure per capita and the ratio of confirmed cases as the best factors to visualize our clusters on. We utilized K-Means clustering by scaling the top factors in order to visually group countries and analyze the similarities between them. We were able to recognize the patterns among the groups by finding the averages of these factors to compare the clusters. Furthermore, we used GMM clustering as an additional baseline and found related clustering results, conclusive enough that further exploration of dissimilar baselines and features can help in more explicit and generalised clusters of countries.</span>
